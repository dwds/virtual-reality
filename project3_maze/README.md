# Udacity VR Nanodegree Project 3 - Maze

## What is this?
This is the third project in Udacity's Virtual Reality Nanodegree. It is a VR maze game built with Unity that runs on an Android device using Google Cardboard. The game features a maze that you must navigate to find and collect coins and a key. Once you have collected the key, then you can unlock the door to the temple, winning the game. The project required the use of scripting to track the state of the key and door, and to create the effect of collecting objects. You can read more about it and see screenshots on [my blog](https://derekds.com/sketchbook/virtual-reality-maze/).

## How can I play it?
Unfortunatley, the APK file is too big to upload to github. You'll have to settle for screenshots and the [gameplay video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn-V2HVN2PA).

## Who made this?
Udacity provided the starter project files, which included prefab maze walls, temple, coins, key, etc. I had to design the maze and place the walls, coins, and key in the scene to make a playable game. I also wrote scripts to create the interactions in the game, such as the sound effects and animation upon collecting coins, tracking whether or not the key has been collected, and animating the door opening. You can read all the requirements on the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/298/view).

## Planned improvements
At some point I plan to come back to this project to make improvements, such as
- Create a UI to track and display the number of coins collected.
- Make the key collectable only after finding all seven coins.
- Create "floating" animation for coins and key.
- Make sound effect for trying to open the door without a key.
- Tweak the placement of the waypoints.
- Improve placement and symmetry of objects.
- Add more objects of interest to the maze.
