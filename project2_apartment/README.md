# Udacity VR Nanodegree Project 2 - Apartment

## What is this?
This is the second project in Udacity's Virtual Reality Nanodegree. It is a VR apartment scene built with Unity that runs on an Android device using Google Cardboard. The scene features precisely arranged furniture, lighting, and an animated spinning globe. Tapping the screen or pressing the Google Cardboard button will move you around the apartment, as well as starting & stopping the spinning globe. I wrote about working on this project in [a blog post](https://derekds.com/sketchbook/learning-virtual-reality/).

## How can I view it?
To view it, install the APK file located at '/Build/project2Apartment_dadian-smith.apk' on an Android phone. You will need a Google Cardboard viewer to experience the app in Virtual Reality.

## Who made this?
Udacity provided the starter project files, which included an empty apartment scene with a floor and walls. They also provided prefab furniture models and materials, which I had to place in the scene, making sure that everything was placed in a way that made sense and did not intersect with other surfaces. I also added all the lights to the scene, and set up the globe animation which is triggered by tapping the screen. You can read all the requirements on the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/297/view).

## Known issues
- For some reason the scene is much darker when deployed to Android than it appears in Unity. This is apparently an issue that sometimes happens in Unity 5.5, with no known fix. I have tried to compensate for this by increasing the intensity of the lights in Unity.

## Technical details
- Created with Unity 5.5.1p1 on Windows 10,
- and Google VR SDK for Unity version 1.0.
- Built for Android.
- Tested on a Samsung Galaxy S5, Android 6.0.1.
